# Syncopated
## Preface
Syncopated was made to showcase all the bypasses, methods, and exploits ever used in the 2016-2020 era of Roblox exploiting. Syncopated, contains 3 different retcheck bypasses, and 2 different methods of obtaining Lua State. The user running Syncopated, literally gets to choose how the exploit functions. You can choose how you want to get Lua State, and how you want to get retcheck. Please keepin mind, this is a *demo*, it will never be a full fledged script executor. Right now, all it will do is print out "done lol" to Roblox's console (print("done lol")) via the Lua C API. I will be working on this in my spare time to bring it more features, more exploits, more bypasses, etc. So stay tuned
